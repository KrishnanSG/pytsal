An easy to use low-code open-source python framework for Time Series analysis, visualization and forecasting along with AutoTS.

## Why was pytsal created?

I was deeply inspired by **[pycaret](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret)** which is an amazing library for **Machine Learning**, and I wanted to create a similar library for **Time Series Analysis**.

Therefore, the interface and features provided are very similar to pycaret but focused and customized towards **Time Series**.

### What does pytsal mean?

Pytsal is the abbreviation for **Py**thon **T**ime **S**eries **A**nalysis **L**ibrary

### Examples & Tutorials

Tutorials on how to use the library can be found under the [examples folder](https://github.com/KrishnanSG/pytsal/tree/master/examples)

The tutorials clearly explain how to use the library and also provide basic guide to understand time series analysis.

- [Forecasting tutorial](https://github.com/KrishnanSG/pytsal/blob/master/examples/101_forecasting.ipynb)
- [Anomaly detection tutorial](https://github.com/KrishnanSG/pytsal/blob/master/examples/101_anomaly_detection.ipynb)


## Stability

The library isn't mature or stable for production use yet. 

The best use of the library currently would be for **non production use and rapid prototyping**.
